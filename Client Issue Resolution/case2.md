# Case 2: Login and Password Reset Issue Resolution

## Issue Description
A client has reported difficulty in logging in despite providing the correct username and password combination. Additionally, when attempting to reset the password through the "Forgot password?" feature, they are not receiving the recovery email with the link.

## Solution Steps
To resolve the issue where a client is having difficulty logging in and not receiving the password reset email, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Initial Verification:**
   - Confirm the client's login credentials to ensure that they are indeed providing the correct username and password credentials.

2. **Account Lockout Check:**
   - Verify if there is an account lockout policy in place that may have temporarily locked the client's account due to multiple failed login attempts.

3. **Spam Folder Check:**
   - Advise the client to check their email spam or junk folder for the password reset email, as sometimes such emails can be filtered there.

4. **Email Configuration Review:**
   - Engage with the Backend Developer to investigate the email logic responsible for sending password reset emails.
   - Ensure that the email server is functioning correctly and not experiencing any issues that could prevent email delivery.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the incident, including the client's report, actions taken to investigate, and any resolutions or workarounds implemented.

6. **Follow-up with the Client:**
   - Contact the client to confirm that they can now log in or reset their password successfully.
   - Gather feedback to ensure their satisfaction and address any concerns.

7. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Collaborate with the development team to implement measures that prevent future occurrences of login and email delivery issues.
