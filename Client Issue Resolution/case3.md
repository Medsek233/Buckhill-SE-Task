## Solution Steps
To resolve the issue where a client is encountering issues during the payment stage, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Confirm the details of the issue, including the specific point in the payment process where the screen freezes and any error messages, if present.
   - Check the payment provider status if the problem is coming from their end

2. **Immediate Assistance:**

3. **Technical Investigation:**
   - Engage with the Backend Developer to examine the technical aspects of the payment process.
   - Check for any error logs or system reports that can provide insights into the problem's root cause.
