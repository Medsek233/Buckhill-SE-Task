# Case 1: Pricing Issue Resolution

## Issue Description
The client has brought to our attention an issue concerning the final price displayed during their purchase. They bought one item for 35Kn and two items for 20Kn each, but the final price shown on the screen was 85Kn.

## Solution Steps
To resolve the issue where the client encountered an incorrect final price during their purchase, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Communicate with the Client:**
   - Contact the client to acknowledge their concern and inform them that the issue is being investigated. Provide them with a timeline for resolution.

2. **Initial Verification:**
   - Confirm the client's reported discrepancy in pricing by reviewing their purchase details and the final price displayed on the screen.

3. **Logic Check:**
   - Understand how the pricing logic and calculations are implemented in the system.
   - Collaborate with the solution engineering team to identify any issues or discrepancies in the pricing rules that may have led to the incorrect total.

4. **Backend Developer Involvement:**
   - Report the issue to the Backend Developer to investigate the backend processes responsible for calculating and displaying the final price. Verify if there are any errors in the data processing or pricing calculation algorithms that resulted in the incorrect total.

5. **Frontend Developer Review:**
   - Contact the Frontend Developer to ensure that the final price is correctly displayed to the client on the user interface. Check for any issues in how the frontend is presenting and updating the total price during the purchase process.

6. **Issue Resolution and Testing:**
   - Collaborate with the relevant teams to rectify the pricing issue. This may involve correcting logic rules, fixing backend calculations, or updating frontend displays.
   - Thoroughly test the system to ensure that the correct final price is now displayed during the purchase process.

7. **Documentation and Quality Assurance:**
   - Document the entire incident, including the client's complaint, the steps taken to investigate, and the resolution.
   - Implement quality checks and validation processes to prevent similar pricing discrepancies in the future.

8. **Follow-up with the Client:**
   - Contact the client again to confirm that the pricing issue has been resolved and the correct final price is now displayed. Seek feedback to ensure their satisfaction and address any additional concerns.
